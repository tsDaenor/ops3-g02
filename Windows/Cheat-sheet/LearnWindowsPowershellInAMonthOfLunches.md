#### Chapter 9: Filtering and comparisons

##### 9.3 Comparison operators

* `-eq`: Equality, as in 5 -eq 5 (which is True) or "hello" -eq "help" (which is False)
* `-ne`: Not equal to, as in 10 -ne 5 (which is True) or "help" -ne "help" (which is False, because they are, in fact, equal, and we were testing to see if they were inequal)
* `-ge and -le`: Greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to, as in 10 -ge 5 (True) or Get-Date -le '2012-12-02' (which will depend on when you run this, and shows how dates can be compared in this fashion)
* `-gt and -lt`: Greater than and less than, as in 10 -lt 10 (False) or 100 -gt 10 (True)
* `(5 -gt 10) -and (10 -gt 100)` is False, because one or both subexpressions were False.
* `(5 -gt 10) -or (10 -lt 100)` is True, because at least one subexpression was True.
* `-like` accepts * as a wildcard, so you can compare to see if `"Hello" -like "*ll*"` (that would be True). `-notlike` is the reverse, and both are caseinsensitive; use `-clike` and `-cnotlike` for case-sensitive comparisons
* `-match` makes a comparison between a string of text and a regular expression pattern. `-notmatch` is its logical opposite, and as you might expect, `-cmatch` and `-cnotmatch` provide case-sensitive versions. Regular expressions are beyond the scope of what weâ€™ll cover in this book.
